Python Venv EnvBuilder API

*********************************** EnvBuilder API *********************************************
 
The high-level method described above makes use of a simple API which provides mechanisms for third-party virtual environment creators to customize
environment creation according to their needs, the EnvBuilder class.

class venv.EnvBuilder(system_site_packages=False, clear=False, symlinks=False, upgrade=False, with_pip=False, prompt=None)

The EnvBuilder class accepts the following keyword arguments on instantiation:

> system_site_packages – a Boolean value indicating that the system Python site-packages should be available to the environment (defaults to False).

> clear – a Boolean value which, if true, will delete the contents of any existing target directory, before creating the environment.

> symlinks – a Boolean value indicating whether to attempt to symlink the Python binary (and any necessary DLLs or other binaries, e.g. pythonw.exe), rather
             than copying.

> upgrade – a Boolean value which, if true, will upgrade an existing environment with the running Python - for use when that Python has been upgraded 
            in-place (defaults to False).

> with_pip – a Boolean value which, if true, ensures pip is installed in the virtual environment. This uses ensurepip with the --default-pip option.

> prompt – a String to be used after virtual environment is activated (defaults to None which means directory name of the environment would be used).
 

Creators of third-party virtual environment tools will be free to use the provided EnvBuilder class as a base class.
 
The returned env-builder is an object which has a method, 'create', defined as follows.

create(env_dir)

This method takes as required argument the path (absolute or relative to the current directory) of the target directory which is to contain the virtual 
environment. 

The create method will either create the environment in the specified directory, or raise an appropriate exception.
 
The create method of the EnvBuilder class illustrates the hooks available for subclass customization:
